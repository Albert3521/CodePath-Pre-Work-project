**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Albert Angulo**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/brass-vanilla-scowl?path=index.html%3A2%3A11

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[My biggest challenge was writing the conditional logic myself. I was able to get some parts down, but I knew I was missing things because it did not seem correct. When I checked my code with the one provided, I realized what I was missing and doing wrong and was able to understand what I was lacking in the code. Another challenge I faced was being able to understand what I was doing regarding the code and the work I was doing. Although I was following instructions, I really wanted to learn what I was doing and to see if I was able to proceed in it without needing any help. Understanding some of the concepts on my own proved to be difficult as well. For me to understand the work well and what I was doing I began to read every explanation many times. Once I felt that I had a firm grasp on the concept and what I needed to do, I would proceed with the next step and tried doing it myself trying to not copy what was given to me. I also began writing steps down and the explanations as to what each class and function was for. Doing that helps me understand what I am doing and what I need to do next.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I want to know how much further I can go with web development. I know with coding the limit’s the sky, but I want to know how much I can accomplish with just web development and how that can help me with future endeavors when it comes to coding. Does this work help me improve in other skills, like developing an application? I want to know to what extents I can take web development. I wonder what other kinds of games I can develop and how far I can take them. I remember playing many games when I was younger online. It makes me wonder if they were developed this way or if there was a similarity between how I made this simple game and the intensity of 2D shooter with higher graphic potential. I would love to know how much further I can go in Web Developing and what I can accomplish with it alone.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to do this project I would add different features to the game. I would like to add different images for the buttons when they would be clicked on. Changing the sounds of the buttons would be something I would like to do. To make the game more difficult is something else I would’ve wanted to do. Changing the pattern after every turn whether it was a win or a loss. Changing the colors to be different when pressed down to cause confusion when it is going fast. Adding more buttons to it would make it more difficult as well and that would be something else, I would have wanted to do.]
